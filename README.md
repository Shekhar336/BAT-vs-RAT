# BAT vs RAT Project

## Overview
This project analyses the foraging behaviour of Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in the presence of Black Rats (Rattus rattus). The study investigates whether bats perceive rats as competitors or potential predators, using observational data collected over a 7-month period.

## Datasets
1. **dataset1.csv** – Bat landing events with behavioural observations.
2. **dataset2.csv** – Rat arrival events and aggregated bat activity in 30-minute intervals.

## Objective
Perform descriptive and inferential data analysis to investigate:
- Bat avoidance behaviour and vigilance when rats are present.
- Statistical analysis to test risk-taking behaviour and food access.

## Python Code
- `Investigation.py` – Main Python script for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and visualization.

## Key Python Packages Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- statistics  
- matplotlib  
- scipy  
- statsmodels  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shekhar336/BAT-vs-RAT.git
Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
RUN th PYTHON CODE.
